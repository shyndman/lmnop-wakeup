# BriefingAnnouncer Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Environment Configuration
- **File:** `src/lmnop_wakeup/env.py`
- **Added:** Three new environment variables:
  - `MUSIC_ASSISTANT_URL` - Music Assistant server URL
  - `MUSIC_ASSISTANT_PLAYER_ID` - Target player ID for announcements
  - `WAKEUP_SERVER_BASE_URL` - Base URL that Music Assistant can reach back to
- **Added:** Getter functions following existing patterns
- **Updated:** `.env.sample` with example values

### 2. BriefingAnnouncer Class (MVP)
- **File:** `src/lmnop_wakeup/audio/announcer.py`
- **Features:**
  - Connection management with timeout handling
  - Player validation (existence and availability)
  - Announcement playback with completion tracking
  - Comprehensive error handling with specific exception types
  - Resource cleanup (connections, sessions)
  - Detailed logging for debugging

**Key Methods:**
- `announce(briefing_url: str) -> bool` - Main entry point
- `_ensure_connected()` - Connection establishment with retries
- `_validate_player()` - Player availability checks
- `_play_announcement()` - Actual announcement execution
- `_wait_for_announcement_completion()` - Polling-based completion tracking

### 3. Server Updates
- **File:** `src/lmnop_wakeup/server.py`

**New Static File Endpoint:**
- `GET /briefing/{briefing_date}/audio` - Serves master MP3 files
- Returns 404 if audio file doesn't exist
- Proper Content-Type headers

**Updated Announce Endpoint:**
- `POST /announce` - Full implementation with error handling
- Validates audio file existence (404 if missing)
- Loads configuration from environment variables
- Creates BriefingAnnouncer and executes announcement
- Waits for completion and returns detailed status
- Comprehensive error handling with specific HTTP status codes

## Error Handling Strategy

### HTTP Status Codes
- **404** - Audio file doesn't exist for the requested date
- **503** - Music Assistant server unreachable
- **500** - Configuration errors, player issues, announcement failures

### Error Response Format
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error_code": "specific_error_code",
  "message": "Human readable message",
  "briefing_date": "2025-01-06",
  "technical_details": {
    "music_assistant_url": "http://music.don:8095",
    "player_id": "bedroom_speaker",
    "exception": "ConnectionTimeout"
  }
}
```

### Success Response Format
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "briefing_date": "2025-01-06",
  "message": "Announcement completed successfully",
  "player_id": "bedroom_speaker"
}
```

## Testing the Implementation

### 1. Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file with:
```bash
MUSIC_ASSISTANT_URL=http://music.don:8095
MUSIC_ASSISTANT_PLAYER_ID=bedroom_speaker
WAKEUP_SERVER_BASE_URL=http://192.168.86.208:8002
```

### 2. Test Static File Serving
```bash
# First generate a briefing for today
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8002/generate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"briefing_date": "2025-01-06"}'

# Then test file serving
curl "http://localhost:8002/briefing/2025-01-06/audio"
```

### 3. Test Announcement
```bash
# Test with existing briefing
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8002/announce" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"briefing_date": "2025-01-06"}'

# Test with non-existent briefing (should return 404)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8002/announce" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"briefing_date": "1999-01-01"}'
```

### 4. Error Testing
```bash
# Test with invalid Music Assistant URL
export MUSIC_ASSISTANT_URL=http://invalid:8095
# Run announcement - should get 503 error

# Test with invalid player ID
export MUSIC_ASSISTANT_PLAYER_ID=non_existent_player
# Run announcement - should get 500 error with player_configuration_error
```

## Integration Points

### With Existing BriefingDirectory
- Uses `BriefingDirectory.for_date()` for type-safe file operations
- Calls `has_master_audio()` for validation
- Uses `master_audio_path` property for file serving

### With Environment System
- Follows existing patterns in `env.py`
- Uses same error handling approach
- Integrates with `assert_env()` validation

### With FastAPI Server
- Consistent error response format
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Structured logging integration

## Architecture Notes

### MVP Scope
This implementation focuses on:
- Basic connection management
- Simple polling-based completion tracking
- Comprehensive error reporting
- Resource cleanup

### Future Enhancements
The design allows for easy extension to add:
- Advanced retry logic with exponential backoff
- Real-time event-based completion tracking
- Player capability discovery
- Multiple player announcement support
- Audio duration detection and validation

## Deployment Considerations

1. **Network Connectivity**: Ensure the wakeup server can reach Music Assistant and vice versa
2. **Player Configuration**: Verify player IDs and availability
3. **File Permissions**: Ensure the server can read briefing MP3 files
4. **Timeout Settings**: Adjust client timeout for longer announcements if needed
5. **Logging**: Monitor logs for connection issues and player problems

The implementation provides excellent visibility into failures with detailed error messages and technical context for debugging issues.
